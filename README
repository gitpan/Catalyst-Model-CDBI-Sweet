NAME
        Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Sweet - Making sweet things sweeter

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Model::CDBI;
        use base 'Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Sweet';
        MyApp::Model::CDBI->connection('DBI:driver:database');
    
        package MyApp::Model::Article;
        use base 'MyApp::Model::CDBI';
    
            ... # table class config here

DESCRIPTION
    This model is a thin wrapper around Class::DBI::Sweet to let you use it
    as a Catalyst Model easily. It's similar to
    Catalyst::Model::CDBI::Plain.

    If you want to use loader, you will probably want to add something like
    this to your CDBI model config section instead:

               left_base_classes       => qw/Class::DBI::Sweet/,

    To see how you can take advantage of this module, please check out the
    Class::DBI::Sweet documentation.
